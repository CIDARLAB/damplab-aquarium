<h3>Latest Changes (Oct. 23)</h3>
<ul class='list'>
  <li>Images for inventory items now link to Angler.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that would render your cart unviewable, and
  protocols taking samples as arguments unstartable due to missing
  items.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oct. 18</h4>
<ul class='list'>
  <li>Sample fields that link to ther samples can now be empty.</li>
  <li>Samples now have up to eight fields (was six)</li>
  <li>Samples now automatically have a description field.</li>
  <li>You can view you samples, anyone elses samples, or everyone's samples.</li>
  <li>You can store data with a sample. Data can be added directly to
    items on the sample page for that item, or can be specified during a
    &lt;produce&gt;. Items in PDL have a data field now that has this data in
    it. See generic/siso.pdl for an
    example. </li>
  <li>Items can be put into a virtual "cart" (for lack of a better
    word). These items are available in a drop down menu when filling
    in arguments of type sample for protocols.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Previous Changes</h3>

<h4>Oct. 15</h4>
<ul class='list'>
  <li>Fixed a bug that incorrectly cloned the production server data
  and resulted in incorrect links between items, samples, object
  types, and sample types. The db clone will now have exactly the same ids
  as the production server has.</li>
  <li>Somewhat more pronouced color differences between production and
  rehearsal servers.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Oct. 14</h4>
<ul class='list'>
  <li>Improved error reporting. More errors are caught, are better explained, and in many
    cases the offending PDL code is shown.</li>
  <li>Produce now tells you the id of the item you are producing, and
    you can add a note to show on the produce page.</li>
  <li>Every job that touched a particular item is now show, and vice
    verse. Look at the log page after running a protocol to see how.</li>
  <li>In take, you can specify a particular item by using its id.</li>
  <li>Arguments can have type <b>sample</b> or type <b>objecttype</b>
    in addition to the old string and number. For arguments named, for
    example, primer_id, BioTurk will know you want an item id that
    refers to a primer and give you a list of projects and samples to
    select from when starting the protocol.</li>
  <li>When copying the production db to your local copy of bioturk,
    you get the sample types and samples too.</li>
</ul>

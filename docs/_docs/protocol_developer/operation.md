# Show Block Documentation

This is the documentation for how to successfully use the `Operation` and `Job` paradigms from within Aquarium protocols, with explanation of commonly used `Operation` methods.

This page will give examples and instructions on how to get started using `Operation` methods, but it is not a comprehensive reference for all `Operation`  related methods. 
See the [API documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /api/index.html %}) for more details on the functions that Krill provides.

If you haven't already, visit the [protocol developer documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/protocol_developer/index.md %}) for information about getting started.

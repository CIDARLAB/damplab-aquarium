# Show Block Documentation

This is the documentation for using `show` blocks to display instructions on the technician view, for use in writing effective Aquarium protocols.

This page will give examples and instructions on how to get started using `show` blocks, but it is not a comprehensive reference for all `show`  related methods. 
See the [API documentation](../../../api/index.html) for more details on the functions that Krill provides.

If you haven't already, visit the [protocol developer documentation](../protocol_developer) for information about getting started.

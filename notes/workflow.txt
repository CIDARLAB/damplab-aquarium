workflow

translating operation specifications to go.js networks

  * who is responsibility is it to translate between the two formats?

    js asks ruby for workflow
      workflow controller gets specification and loads all operations into a big workflow json

    js turns them into go network
      workflow_to_network

    user edits go network
      this puts data in a subfield of the go network

    syncing with backend
      new operations get immediately created via ajax coordination with the backend
        - add operation to db and to workflow
      user edits of an operation are sent to server, changing operation from synced, to unsynced
      adding new identifications immediately are sent to server
      when syncing, ui becomes unavailable

    backend methods, accessible via the workflow controller
      - add operation
      - update operation with i/o etc
      - add identification

workflow

translating operation specifications to go.js networks

  * who is responsibility is it to translate between the two formats?

    js asks ruby for workflow
      workflow controller gets specification and loads all operations into a big workflow json

    js turns them into go network
      workflow_to_network

    user edits go network
    
    js extracts data and sends back to ruby
      network_to_workflow

## Questions
Who is the intended audience? The "expert" should only have to link up operations, while the "programmer" will need to add inputs/outputs and write protocol code.
NOTE: It's super handy for tutorials to be able to link to other tutorials and even handier for them to be able to link to certain headings ("Threads" in WorkflowProtocolAPI.md, for example). Is this possible with both potential "wiki methods"?

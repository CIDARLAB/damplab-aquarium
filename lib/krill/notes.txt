IPC

use rails runner to start an ipc daemon

  - it listens on some port p for messages
  - messages have the form
    push q msg 
      # this creates a queue q if it doesn't already exist
      # then it pushes msg onto it
    pop q
      # removes the last message on the queue named q and returns it

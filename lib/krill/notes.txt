- Krill
  - PCR
    - collections
  - hide rails stuff somehow?

- Inventory
  - Put unsed items back

- Log

- Output for metacols

- Krill from local files (via cleaner ui)

- Standard 
  - Decide where to put it. Should it be included automagically?

- Collection Class

  - Make a collection from an item
    - Throws an error if the item's object_type's handler is not 'collection'
    - If no item is passed, then it makes a new collection, maybe taking rows/cols

    Make a new collection
      c = Collection.new 9, 12

    Promote an item to a collection

      i = Item.find(123)
      c = Collection.new i

    or better    

      c = Collection.new 123

  - Getters and setters for collection matrix and individual slots

      c.set 3, 4, Sample.find(234)
      c.set_matrix m

  - Some way of making a bunch of new collections given an array of samples, like

      clist = Collection.spread sample_list, 1, 12

    which would spread the samples in sample_list over some number of 1x12 collections

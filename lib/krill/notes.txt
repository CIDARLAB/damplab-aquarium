- Inventory
  - Put unsed items back

- Krill from local files (via cleaner ui)

- Transfer 

  - An operation in show{} that takes two collections and a routing matrix. It should
    display the two collections with a highlighted source/destination pair of locations
    along with a statement about what is being transferred. When the use clicks on (say)
    the source, then the transfer is considered made and it is marked. The user should be
    able to go back to already completed transfered, but the markings don't go away.

    - show_block gets transfer from, to, routing and makes a transfer item to send to the UI
    
    - The UI gets just dimensions and item numbers for of from and to. The routing matrix for the UI has
      - r,c,r',c',sample_name,amount(optional).
      - { transfer: { from: { id: 123, rows: 10, cols: 3 }, 
                      to: { id: 234, rows: 5, cols: 6 },
                      routing: [ 
                        { from: [1,1], to: [3,5], name: "pLAB1", volume: 20 },
                        ...
                      ] 
                    } 
        }

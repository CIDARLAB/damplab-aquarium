- Refactor

  - User code

    - User defines a class Protocol in their code. They can define
      anything else they want too. Protocol must have a 'main' method.

  - KrillBase

    - Defines 'show' (formerly 'display') and other methods that will
      appear to be built in to the user.

  - Manager does the following to initialize
  
    - Creates a namespace class that will contain the user's code

        @namespace = NameSpace.new // this will need to def needs
        @namespace.class_eval code
        @protocol = @namespace::Protocol.new

    - Subclasses KrillBase with a new class that defines the method
      job accordingly to get a class variable @krill.

    - Adds @krill as an ancestor to every class in the user's code

    - Sets up thread stuff

- collections

- hide rails stuff somehow

  + slider / history

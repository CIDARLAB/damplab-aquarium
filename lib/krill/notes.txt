- Concurrency
  - Clean up code
  - Decide how to handle exceptions, errors sent from server to client, etc.

  - Browser => Controller
    - Run
    - Next

  - Controller
    - Responds to browser in JSON. Errors must be sent in JSON too.
    - Uses client to send 'run' or continue' to server
  - Server
    - Turns on protocol and either waits for it to stop, or waits N seconds
    - Responds to client with what happened (should not append state of job as is done now)
  - Thread
    - Does its own thing, halting after each show command

- Inventory
  - Put unsed items back

- Krill from local files (via cleaner ui)

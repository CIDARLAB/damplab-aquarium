- find
  + use same interface as before, expect return actual objects and not hashes
  - is there some way to hide rails stuff?

- take

  - new table: takes item_id, job_id

  - takes a list of items, displays them to the user with checkboxes,
    and marks them as taken in the db when the user clicks next

  - in display { take: { id: 0, name: "Plasmid Aliquot", location: "M1.1.2.3', sample: "pASD", type: "Primer" } }

- release

  - releases items 

- produce

- modify

- tables

- collections

- hide protocol methods to prevent display, start, continue from being overwritten
  + obscurify methods
  - hide rails stuff somehow

- including other files

  - write an 'include' like function that reads from the
    repo and evaluates the results to add methods to the protocol
    handler object

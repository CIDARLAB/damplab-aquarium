- deal with asynchrony between server and rails

+ arguments
  + only use json (generic) inputs
  + assume a single argument called 'input'

- user input

- hide protocol methods to prevent display, start, continue from being overwritten
  - obscurify methods
  - hide rails stuff somehow

- including other files

  - write an 'include' like function that reads from the
    repo and evaluates the results to add methods to the protocol
    handler object

- display format

  [ 
    { title: "A title" },
    { note: "A note" },
    { note: "Another note" },
    { warning: "Careful!" },
    { check: "Check" },
    { select: { choices: [ "A", "B", "C" ], var: "x" } },
    { input: { type: string, var: "y" } }
  ]

* Assignments outside of transitions evaluate when parsed. They are used mainly to set
  up global vars, arguments to protocols, etc.

x Condition and action expressions should evaulate when the transition fires.
  x Therefore, the metacol needs the scope and may update the scope when firing.

x Actions in transitions (sets of assignments, evaluated when firing)

x Arguments to protocols

- When a protocol is canceled ror reaches an error, metacol should handle it nicely

- Timing info for protocols (delayed evals)

- To save the state of the metacol, save:
  - scope
  - marking for each place
  - job list for each place

- To update a metacol from bioturk
  - Parse it to obtain a metacol object
  - Get the scope, marking, and joblist from the db
  - Set the "    , "      , "   "       of the metacol, overriding whatever it is upon first parse
  - Take a step (call Metacol.update)
  - Save the scope, marking, and joblist to the db

- To avoid talking to github, I could
  - a) Cache protocols for a given metacol (like I do for jobs)
  - b) Finally make a local directory version of the github repo
  - c) To just make things more fluid, I could get the blob when starting, instead of when parsing
        - would not catch errors up front though
